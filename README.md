# RTBM

## Code locations

This is a preliminary and very simplified version of the layout.
It does not contain `setup.py` yet, but its implementation is trivial.

## Usage

The code runs with python 2.7.x environment and requires cython.

## Installation

During the development you can install this package by doing:

```python
python setup.py develop
```

this will create symlinks to the source code so you don't need to
reinstall the package everytime something changes.

To install it definitivelly do:

```python
python setup.py install
```
