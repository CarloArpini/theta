Welcome to theta's documentation!
=================================

Theta is a machine learning (ML) framework implementing the
Rieman-Theta Boltzmann Machine (RTBM), written in Python and
Cython. It offers a high-level interface to build and train RTBM based
ML architectures for probability density estimation, data regression
and classification.

The code implements the RTBM as described in the theoretical paper
`arXiv:17xx.xxxxx <https://>`_.


.. note::

   Theta is in a proof-of-concept / research phase. You may observe
   that model training requires some fine tune to get proper results.
