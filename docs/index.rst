Welcome to theta's documentation!
=================================

Theta is a machine learning (ML) framework implementing the Rieman-Theta Boltzmann Machine (RTBM),
written in Python and Cython. It offers a high-level interface to build and train RTBM based ML architectures
for probability density estimation, data regression and classification.

The code implements the RTBM as described in the theoretical paper `arXiv:17xx.xxxxx <https://>`_.
